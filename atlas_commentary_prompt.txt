ATLAS SCORE EXPLAINER:
Atlas Composite Score Explainer
The Atlas Composite Score is a simple, objective measure of systemic market risk.
We track 21 Macro and Micro market indicators (like the VIX, Credit Spreads, and Treasury Yields). Each indicator is checked against its own stress thresholds and assigned an individual risk score, ranging from 0.0 (Green/Stable) up to 2.0 (Red/Extreme Stress).
The system then sums all 21 individual scores to create the final Composite Score (maximum 22.5). This final score maps directly to the four clear risk postures: Monitor, Elevated, Severe, or Full-Storm, guiding your portfolio's tactical defense.

RISK DETERMINATION RULES:
The commentary MUST be grounded in the following official Atlas rules:
1. OVERALL STATUS THRESHOLDS (Max Score: 22.5):
   - FULL-STORM: Score > 12.0 (EXTREME RISK)
   - SEVERE RISK: Score > 8.0 (HIGH RISK)
   - ELEVATED RISK: Score > 4.0 (MODERATE RISK)
   - MONITOR: Score <= 4.0 (LOW RISK)

2. KEY RED-STATUS TRIGGERS:
   - VIX (Volatility): Above 22.0
   - US 10Y Yield (Duration Risk): Above 4.75% (The critical 'Atlas Pivot')
   - HY OAS (Credit Risk): Above 400 bps (Systemic funding stress)
   - Bank CDS: Above 150 bps (Banking sector fear)
   - Consumer Delinquencies: Above 3.8% (Household stress)

Live Data Snapshot:
- Current Risk Status: {STATUS}
- Composite Score: {SCORE} / 22.5
- Trend: {TREND}

Key Indicator Data Snapshot:
- Duration Risk: US 10Y Yield @ {US10Y_YIELD}%
- Financial Stress: VIX (Volatility Index) @ {VIX_VALUE}
- Credit Health: HY OAS (High Yield Credit Spread) @ {HYOAS_VALUE} bps
- Inflation Pressure: CPI Year-over-Year @ {INFLATION_VALUE}%
- Economic Activity: ISM Manufacturing PMI @ {PMI_VALUE}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Synthesize the overall risk status based on the "Live Data Snapshot" and Rule #1.
2. Address the primary contradiction: Financial plumbing (VIX, HY OAS) vs. structural problem (US 10Y Yield, Inflation).
3. Conclude by defining the current "Storm Warning" posture and state the key trigger (e.g., HY OAS breach of 400 bps) from Rule #2 that would pivot the status to SEVERE RISK.
4. Do not list the data points directly in the commentary text, only refer to them as categories (e.g., "credit spreads remain contained").
