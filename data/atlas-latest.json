While the majority of triggers are in the 'Amber' band, the sustained VIX and AUDUSD weakness suggest a tentative global risk appetite. This environment allows for flexibility but demands vigilance.\n\n**Key Action:** Maintain protective hedges. The focus should be on liquidity management and avoiding new high-beta positions. The key to de-risking will be a sustained drop in the VIX below 18.0 and a stabilization in the Funding Spread (SOFR\u2013OIS). Top triggers: VIX (US implied vol), US Government shutdown / fiscal risk, Consumer delinquencies (30-day)."
