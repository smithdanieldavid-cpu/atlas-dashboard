FINRA margin debt remains a critical Red indicator, reflecting significant speculative positioning, while consumer delinquencies are also Amber, pointing to underlying household stress. Despite this, the VIX index, though Amber, has not yet reached levels indicative of full market panic, creating a divergence with the broader risk score. Duration risk is evident with US 10-year and 30-year treasury yields in Amber territory, signaling increasing pressure on fixed income. The Red status of AUD/USD and the Small/Large cap ratio further underscore a broad-based deterioration in risk appetite and potential liquidity fragmentation.The external macro environment reinforces caution, with central banks maintaining a hawkish stance as highlighted by Bloomberg's reporting on the Bank of England's decision to keep rates unchanged. Concurrently, Morningstar notes market anticipation for potential Fed rate cuts, creating a policy divergence. Reuters reports a significant weakening in US consumer sentiment, attributed to the ongoing government shutdown, which Morningstar also identifies as a key focus for the week ahead alongside China data. Furthermore, the Financial Times raises concerns regarding the stability of non-bank lenders, suggesting potential vulnerabilities within the financial system. Readers are directed to the News Feed below for the full list of articles reviewed. An escalation to FULL-STORM would be triggered by a US 10-Year Yield move above 4.75% or HY OAS widening beyond 400 bps.",
