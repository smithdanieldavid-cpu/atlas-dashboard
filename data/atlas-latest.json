        "daily_narrative": "Atlas Dashboard analysis reveals an **ELEVATED RISK** posture, despite a moderate quantitative score of 6.0, driven by active core volatility and duration triggers. While market sentiment appears complacent with a low VIX and bullish equity indices (S&P 500, ASX 200), underlying indicators signal growing caution. The sharp rally in gold, coupled with elevated 3-year, 10-year, and 30-year yields, points to rising inflation expectations, fiscal concerns, and significant duration risk.\n\nDigging deeper, market internals are fragile, evidenced by the underperformance of small-caps, suggesting a narrowing breadth of market strength. Critically, extreme margin debt growth (32.9% YoY) implies high liquidation risk, while rising consumer delinquencies highlight emerging credit stress. Given these diverging signals, a disciplined approach is warranted: maintain protective hedges, favor short-duration instruments over intermediate or long locks, and consider increasing real asset allocation. Investors should avoid growth stocks, prefer defensive consumer sectors, and prepare for potential structural equity risk by closely monitoring credit signals."
