This environment of tightening liquidity and heightened caution, as [markets brace for life after global easing cycle](https://www.reuters.com/markets/markets-brace-life-after-global-easing-cycle-2025-11-06/), aligns with Atlas's current posture of SEVERE RISK. Despite a relatively subdued VIX index at 19.50 (Amber), Atlas's Composite Score of 8.50 is primarily driven by critical systemic indicators in the Leverage category. Specifically, a significant surge in FINRA margin debt (YOY %) at 32.94 (Red, Score: 1.50) highlights excessive speculative leverage in the system. Further contributing to this elevated risk posture are rising consumer delinquencies at 3.05 (Amber, Score: 1.00), signaling underlying stress in household balance sheets. The next critical pivot points that would trigger a 'FULL-STORM' risk level are a breach of the US 10-Year Yield threshold at 4.75% or the High Yield OAS reaching 400 bps.",
