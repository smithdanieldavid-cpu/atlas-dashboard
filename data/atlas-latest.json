Meanwhile, Fed officials like Hammack continue to signal inflation as a primary concern over the labor market, as reported by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-06/fed-s-hammack-says-inflation-a-bigger-concern-than-labor-market). This policy divergence, coupled with the Swedish Riksbank's uncertain economic outlook, as stated by Thedeen via [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/swedish-riksbanks-thedeen-says-outlook-economic-activity-inflation-is-uncertain-2025-11-06/), creates a complex and potentially fragile global environment, reinforcing Atlas's current SEVERE RISK posture. Internally, Atlas's Composite Score of 10.50, signaling SEVERE RISK, is predominantly driven by critical systemic indicators in Liquidity and Leverage. Specifically, `Treasury net liquidity` stands at a deeply concerning -6,571,780.27 (Red, Score: 2.00), indicating significant strain, while `FINRA margin debt (YOY %)` at 32.94% (Red, Score: 1.50) points to elevated speculative leverage. This high-risk internal signal stands in stark contrast to the relatively subdued VIX index at 19.50 (Amber) and the 'Green' status of major equity indices like the S&P 500, suggesting a potential complacency in broader market sentiment. The critical Atlas pivot points for a shift to FULL-STORM risk remain the US 10-Year Yield breaching 4.75% or the High Yield OAS exceeding 400 bps, both of which warrant vigilant monitoring.",
