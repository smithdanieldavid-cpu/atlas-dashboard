Key drivers include elevated leverage as evidenced by the Red-rated FINRA margin debt (YOY % at 32.94%) and Amber-rated consumer delinquencies (3.05%). Duration risk remains a concern with the US 30yr treasury yield at 4.74% and the US 10yr treasury yield at 4.17%, both in Amber status. The Amber VIX (19.50) and Green High Yield OAS (3.05) present a contradictory signal, suggesting market complacency despite underlying leverage and duration vulnerabilities. The global macro tone reflects a cautious shift away from accommodative policies, as highlighted by Reuters reporting on markets bracing for the end of the global easing cycle. Central bank commentary, including the ECB's Vujcic warning of market risks per Bloomberg, underscores this transition. While Bloomberg also notes resilience in specific regions like Japan's household spending, broader economic risks are being assessed, as discussed by Rajan on global and Indian economic conditions. Readers are directed to the News Feed below for the full list of articles reviewed. Escalation to FULL-STORM would be triggered by a US 10-Year Yield move above 4.75% or HY OAS widening beyond 400 bps.",
