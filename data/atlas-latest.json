This high-risk assessment is strongly corroborated by recent news, which paints a complex and increasingly challenging global economic picture. While some earlier reports from the IMF (July 2023, Oct 2024) suggested a potential soft landing and moderating inflation, with the US acting as an engine of growth, the overarching narrative remains one of significant caution. The IMF has consistently warned of a \"gloomier\" outlook due to persistent inflation and tightening monetary policy (Nov 2022, Oct 2024). More critically, the latest reports (March/April 2025) highlight a surging risk of global economic recession, primarily driven by the re-emergence of US tariff shockwaves and the potential for renewed trade wars under President Trump's policies. These tariffs are projected to sap growth in key economies and drive up inflation, creating a dual threat that compounds existing geopolitical risks. The ongoing inflation risks may even prompt central banks, such as the BOJ, to consider rate hikes, further tightening global financial conditions.",
