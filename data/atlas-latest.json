        "daily_narrative": "The Atlas Dashboard currently signals an **ELEVATED RISK** environment, with a score of 6.0, urging caution for the disciplined investor. While headline equity indices like the S&P 500 are trading near highs and the VIX indicates low implied volatility, several critical indicators suggest underlying fragility. Core duration triggers are active, with the 10-Year Treasury yield exceeding its 4.0% alarm threshold, reflecting persistent long-term fiscal and inflation concerns. This bond market pressure is further compounded by a sharp rally in gold, pointing towards rising inflation expectations or systemic risk.\n\nBeneath the surface calm, market internals are showing signs of stress. Extreme margin debt growth at 32.9% year-over-year presents a substantial liquidation risk, while the significant underperformance of small-cap stocks indicates fragile market breadth. Additionally, rising consumer delinquencies warrant caution for banks and consumer-facing sectors. For the disciplined investor, Atlas advises proceeding with caution: maintain protective hedges, reduce leveraged positions, and favor quality/large-cap exposures over growth/cyclical stocks. Limit exposure to long-duration assets, preferring short-term or floating-rate instruments, and consider increasing real asset allocation to mitigate inflation and systemic risks.",
