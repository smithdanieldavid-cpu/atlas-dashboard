FINRA margin debt continues to rise significantly year-over-year, indicating increased speculative positioning, while the Small/Large cap ratio remains Red, reflecting a clear preference for larger, more stable assets and a contraction in risk appetite. Consumer delinquencies are also Amber, pointing to underlying credit stress. This elevated risk is somewhat masked by a VIX index that, while Amber, does not fully reflect the underlying leverage and duration exposures, suggesting a potential complacency in volatility pricing. The global macro environment reinforces this cautious outlook, with Reuters reporting that markets are bracing for the end of the global easing cycle, suggesting tighter financial conditions ahead. Bloomberg highlights broader global economic risks, while the Financial Times notes an expected slump in US holiday hiring due to slowing consumer spending, further underscoring demand-side weakness. For a full list of articles reviewed, please refer to the News Feed below. An escalation to FULL-STORM would be triggered by the US 10-Year Yield moving above 4.75% or HY OAS widening beyond 400 bps.",
