This internal discord, coupled with \"[European Midday Briefing: Stocks Lower Amid Valuation Fears ...](https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/202511052907/european-midday-briefing-stocks-lower-amid-valuation-fears)\" and ongoing trade policy uncertainties like \"[Trump Tariffs in Court Today ... | Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/202511053725/north-american-morning-briefing-trump-tariffs-in-court-today)\", contributes to an environment of elevated external risk. Despite \"[US Treasuries Remain Top Debt Market Despite Policy Turbulence](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisgunster/2025/11/05/us-treasuries-remain-top-debt-market-despite-policy-turbulence/)\", the broader geopolitical and policy landscape reinforces Atlas's current posture of Elevated Risk. Internally, Atlas's composite score of 7.75, signaling Elevated Risk, is primarily driven by critical systemic indicators. Specifically, the \"[FINRA margin debt (YOY %)](https://www.finra.org/investors/market-data/margin-statistics)\" at 32.94 (Red, Score: 1.50) highlights a significant build-up of leverage within the system. Complementing this, the \"[Small/Large cap ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/small-cap-large-cap-ratio.asp)\" at 0.36 (Red, Score: 1.00) indicates deteriorating market breadth and a flight from riskier, smaller capitalization assets. This elevated internal risk posture exists despite the VIX index remaining in the Amber zone at 18.01, suggesting a potential complacency in volatility measures relative to underlying systemic pressures. The next critical pivot point for Atlas to move into a FULL-STORM risk level would be a breach of the 4.75% threshold for the US 10-Year Treasury Yield or a rise in the High Yield OAS to 400 bps.",
