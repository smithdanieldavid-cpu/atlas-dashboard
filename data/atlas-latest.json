Reports highlighting \"[Fed divisions threaten Powell's era of consensus | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-divisions-threaten-powells-era-consensus-2025-11-04/)\" and \"[What Does a Divided Fed Mean for Investors? | Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/economy/what-does-divided-fed-mean-investors)\" underscore potential shifts in monetary policy predictability, while \"[European Midday Briefing: Stocks Lower Amid Valuation Fears ...](https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/202511052907/european-midday-briefing-stocks-lower-amid-valuation-fears)\" indicates growing apprehension regarding market valuations. This external backdrop of geopolitical and policy flux aligns with the Atlas system's current assessment of heightened systemic risk. Despite a relatively subdued VIX index at 18.01 (Amber) and seemingly stable equity markets (S&P 500, ASX 200 Green), the Atlas Composite Score of 10.00, indicating SEVERE RISK, is primarily driven by critical systemic vulnerabilities. Specifically, Treasury net liquidity is deep in 'Red' territory at -6,586,063.20 (Score: 2.00), signaling significant liquidity strain. Concurrently, FINRA margin debt (YOY %) is alarmingly high at 32.94% (Red, Score: 1.50), reflecting excessive leverage within the system. The Small/Large cap ratio also registers 'Red' at 0.36 (Score: 1.00), pointing to deteriorating market breadth and risk appetite. The key Atlas pivot points that would trigger a 'FULL-STORM' risk level are a breach of the US 10yr treasury yield above 4.75% or the High yield OAS exceeding 400 bps, both of which remain below these critical thresholds for now, but warrant close monitoring given the underlying systemic stress.",
