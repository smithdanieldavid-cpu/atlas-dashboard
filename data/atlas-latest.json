FINRA margin debt shows a significant year-over-year increase, indicating elevated speculative positioning, while the AUD/USD exchange rate remains Red, reflecting broader risk-off sentiment. The Small/Large cap ratio also registers Red, suggesting a preference for larger, more stable assets over smaller, growth-oriented companies. This is occurring despite the VIX index remaining in Amber territory, not yet signaling extreme market fear, which presents a potential contradiction given the underlying leverage and duration risks highlighted by Amber US Treasury yields and consumer delinquencies. The global macro environment is characterized by increasing data uncertainty and shifting inflation dynamics. Bloomberg highlights an intensifying data fog for the Federal Reserve due to delayed US inflation numbers, complicating policy decisions. Concurrently, Reuters reports easing factory-gate deflation in China, alongside a modest rise in consumer prices, suggesting some stabilization in the world's second-largest economy. Meanwhile, Bloomberg also notes a rare inflation flip favoring emerging markets over developed nations, indicating divergent global economic paths. Domestically, an FT report cites a Fed official warning that the growing wealth disparity risks a US downturn. For a comprehensive list of articles, please refer to the News Feed below. The posture would escalate to FULL-STORM should the US 10-Year Yield move above 4.75% or HY OAS widen beyond 400 bps.",
