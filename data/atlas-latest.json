Persistent inflation, despite some signs of slowing, remains a significant concern, driving monetary policy tightening and posing a primary risk to economic stability. Furthermore, the specter of geopolitical risks and potential trade wars, particularly the 'US tariff shockwaves' mentioned in recent reports, threatens to derail global growth and push major economies into recession. Investors should remain highly vigilant as the global economy navigates these complex and interconnected challenges.",
