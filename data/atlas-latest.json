Critical Red indicators include FINRA margin debt, which shows a significant year-over-year increase, alongside a Red signal from the Small/Large cap ratio, indicating a flight from smaller, more speculative assets. Amber signals from the US 10-year and 30-year treasury yields underscore persistent duration risk. While the VIX remains at an Amber level, it does not fully reflect the underlying leverage build-up and rising consumer delinquencies, suggesting a potential complacency in volatility pricing despite clear signs of systemic stress.\nThe external macro environment reinforces this cautious outlook. As highlighted by Morningstar and Bloomberg, ongoing US shutdown developments are impacting the availability of critical economic data, complicating the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision-making process. Investing.com reports a general struggle in risk markets due to a lack of bullish catalysts, while Bloomberg also features discussions on global and Indian economic risks. Fixed income markets remain a key area of focus, as detailed by Bloomberg's fixed income coverage and a shareholder letter from Dodge & Cox. Readers are directed to the News Feed below for the full list of articles reviewed. An escalation to FULL-STORM would be triggered by the US 10-Year Yield moving above 4.75% or High Yield OAS widening beyond 400 bps.",
