Concurrently, ongoing trade policy disputes, as evidenced by [North American Morning Briefing: Trump Tariffs in Court Today ...](https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/202511053725/north-american-morning-briefing-trump-tariffs-in-court-today), continue to contribute to a fragile external environment. This backdrop of policy ambiguity and persistent friction aligns precisely with Atlas's current 'SEVERE RISK' posture, suggesting that systemic vulnerabilities are being exacerbated by a lack of clear global economic direction. Internally, Atlas's 'SEVERE RISK' composite score of 10.00 is predominantly driven by critical 'Red' status systemic indicators, particularly within Liquidity and Leverage. Treasury net liquidity, scoring 2.00, signals significant stress in the financial system's plumbing, while FINRA margin debt (YOY %), at 1.50, points to elevated leverage within market participants. This internal deterioration stands in stark contrast to the VIX index, which, at 18.01 (Amber), does not yet reflect the full extent of underlying systemic risk. The critical Atlas pivot points that would trigger a 'FULL-STORM' risk level are a breach of the US 10-Year Yield threshold at 4.75% or the High Yield OAS exceeding 400 bps.",
