Reports indicate \"Fed divisions threaten Powell's era of consensus\" ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-divisions-threaten-powells-era-consensus-2025-11-04/)), contributing to \"Global Markets Fall after Fed officials express diverging views on cuts\" ([Dow Jones](https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/202511045063/dow-jones-top-markets-headlines-at-7-am-et-global-markets-fall-after-fed-officials-express-diverging-views-on-cuts-whats)). Simultaneously, the \"Bank of Japan debated growing case for rate hike\" ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/boj-board-debated-pros-cons-rate-hike-pause-september-minutes-shows-2025-11-05/)), while the UK faces warnings that \"Reeves Must Run Surpluses to Stop UK Debt Surging\" ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/reeves-must-run-surpluses-to-stop-uk-debt-surging-niesr-says)). This confluence of factors has prompted \"Gold Rebounds on Haven Demand as Risk-Off Mood Rattles Markets\" ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/gold-holds-drop-as-investors-weigh-outlook-for-dollar-us-rates)), aligning with Atlas's elevated risk posture.\nInternally, Atlas's Composite Score of 10.00, signaling SEVERE RISK, is primarily driven by critical systemic indicators in Liquidity and Leverage. Specifically, \"Treasury net liquidity\" is deep in Red territory with a score of 2.00, indicating significant systemic strain. Concurrently, \"FINRA margin debt (YOY %)\" registers a Red status with a score of 1.50, highlighting excessive leverage in the system. The \"Small/Large cap ratio\" also signals Red (1.00), reflecting a flight from riskier assets. This high Atlas score stands in stark contrast to the currently \"Green\" status of the High Yield OAS (3.04 bps), which suggests credit markets are not yet pricing in the full extent of the underlying systemic fragility. The key Atlas pivot points to watch for a shift to FULL-STORM risk are a breach of the 4.75% threshold for the US 10-Year Yield or a rise in the HY OAS to 400 bps.",
