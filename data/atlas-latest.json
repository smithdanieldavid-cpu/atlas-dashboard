Key Red flags include elevated FINRA margin debt, indicating significant leverage risk, and a deteriorating AUD/USD exchange rate, reflecting broader risk aversion or commodity sensitivity. Consumer delinquencies are also Amber, pointing to emerging credit stress. While long-end US Treasury yields remain Amber, signaling duration risk, the VIX index is only Amber, and High Yield OAS remains Green. This presents a notable contradiction, as market volatility and credit spreads do not yet fully reflect the underlying leverage build-up and increasing consumer credit deterioration.\nThe external macro environment adds to this complexity. As highlighted by Bloomberg, a 'data fog' due to a government shutdown is intensifying for the Fed, complicating the assessment of US inflation and future policy. Reuters reports that China's factory-gate deflation is easing, with consumer prices rising, suggesting some stabilization in the world's second-largest economy. However, a Federal Reserve official, as noted by the Financial Times, warns that the widening gulf between rich and poor risks a US downturn, introducing a socio-economic dimension to policy considerations. Morningstar also discusses potential implications of Fed rate cuts and China trade for investment strategies. Readers are directed to the News Feed below for full articles. The posture would escalate to FULL-STORM if the US 10-Year Yield moves above 4.75% or HY OAS widens beyond 400 bps.",
