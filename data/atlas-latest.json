Key contributors to this elevated risk include Red flags in FINRA margin debt, indicating significant leverage accumulation, and the Small/Large cap ratio, suggesting a contraction in risk appetite and duration exposure. Amber alerts for consumer delinquencies further underscore credit quality concerns. While the VIX remains at a moderate 19.08, this apparent calm in volatility contradicts the underlying leverage and duration risks highlighted by other indicators, including the Amber status of US Treasury yields, particularly the 10-year at 4.11%.\nThe external macro environment reinforces a cautious outlook, with Reuters reporting on weakening US consumer sentiment, partly due to government shutdown concerns, and Investing.com noting a general struggle in risk markets from a lack of bullish catalysts. Bloomberg highlights growing skepticism among investors regarding AI's market impact, while the Financial Times raises concerns about the reliability of non-bank lenders, pointing to potential vulnerabilities in the broader credit landscape. Morningstar and Dow Jones also emphasize ongoing focus on US shutdown developments. For the full list of articles reviewed, please refer to the News Feed below. An escalation to FULL-STORM would be triggered by the US 10-Year Yield moving above 4.75% or HY OAS widening beyond 400 bps.",
