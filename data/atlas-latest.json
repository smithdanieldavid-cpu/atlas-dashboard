The macro picture is dominated by the repricing of long-term rates (30Y Yield), reflecting deep concern over U.S. fiscal dominance and structural inflation. This macro pressure is feeding into micro fragility, specifically seen in the small-cap underperformance and rising earnings-revision breadth concerns.\n\n**Key Action:** This is a Storm Posture. Aggressively limit duration exposure and maintain protective equity hedges. The market is sensitive to any negative news flow, especially concerning US fiscal policy or unexpected central bank moves. Top triggers: WTI Crude Oil, US Government shutdown / fiscal risk, Earnings-revision breadth."
