This internal signal suggests a growing undercurrent of systemic stress that warrants heightened vigilance from disciplined institutional investors, irrespective of the broader news cycle.\n\nThe primary drivers contributing to the Composite Score's ELEVATED RISK status are concentrated in systemic leverage and market breadth. Specifically, the 'Red' status of FINRA margin debt (YOY % at 32.94, scoring 1.50) indicates a significant build-up of leverage within the market, a classic precursor to instability. Concurrently, the 'Red' status of the Small/Large cap ratio (0.36, scoring 1.00) points to a clear preference for larger, more stable companies, signaling a contraction in risk appetite and potential liquidity stress for smaller enterprises. This internal Atlas data presents a notable divergence from the 'Green' status of the High Yield OAS (380.00), which suggests a degree of complacency in credit markets. The critical Atlas Pivot points to watch for a shift to a FULL-STORM risk level are a breach of 4.75% in the US 10-Year Yield or an expansion of the High Yield OAS beyond 400 bps.",
