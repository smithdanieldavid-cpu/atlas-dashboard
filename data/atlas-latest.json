Recent reports highlight [Fed divisions threaten Powell's era of consensus | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-divisions-threaten-powells-era-consensus-2025-11-04/) and question [What Does a Divided Fed Mean for Investors? | Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/economy/what-does-divided-fed-mean-investors), signaling internal policy turbulence that can fuel volatility. This is compounded by broader market apprehension, as evidenced by [European Midday Briefing: Stocks Lower Amid Valuation Fears ...](https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/202511052907/european-midday-briefing-stocks-lower-amid-valuation-fears) and ongoing trade policy uncertainty with [North American Morning Briefing: Trump Tariffs in Court Today ...](https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/202511053725/north-american-morning-briefing-trump-tariffs-in-court-today), all contributing to a cautious external risk sentiment.\n\nInternally, Atlas's Composite Score of 10.00, signaling SEVERE RISK, is primarily driven by critical systemic liquidity and leverage indicators. Specifically, `Treasury net liquidity` is deep in 'Red' territory with a score of 2.00, indicating significant systemic stress, while `FINRA margin debt (YOY %)` also registers 'Red' with a score of 1.50, pointing to elevated leverage within the market. The `Small/Large cap ratio` further supports this defensive posture with a 'Red' status and a score of 1.00, suggesting capital flight from riskier assets. While the VIX index remains 'Amber' at 18.01, not yet signaling extreme panic, this apparent calm belies the underlying systemic vulnerabilities identified by Atlas. The critical pivot points for a move to FULL-STORM risk remain the US 10-Year Treasury Yield, which would need to breach 4.75%, and the High Yield OAS, which would need to exceed 400 bps.",
